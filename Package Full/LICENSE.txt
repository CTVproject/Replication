***** DATA *********

- the Survey of Income and Program Participations is a nationally representative longitudinal survey run by the US Census Bureau. We have accessed it through the NBER's public use data archive, using Jean Roth's (NBER) do/dct files for the SIPP, made available under a GNU GPL license.

- This replication package also uses CPS - IPUMS data. (Sarah Flood, Miriam King, Renae Rodgers, Steven Ruggles, J. Robert Warren and Michael Westberry. Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, Current Population Survey: Version 10.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2022. https://doi.org/10.18128/D030.V10.0)

-- We further use the occupational crosswalks provided by David Dorn (www.ddorn.net; David Autor and David Dorn. "The Growth of Low Skill Service Jobs and the Polarization of the U.S. Labor Market." American Economic Review, 103(5), 1553-1597, 2013.).
