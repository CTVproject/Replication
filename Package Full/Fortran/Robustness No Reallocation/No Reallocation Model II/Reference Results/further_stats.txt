 mM ratio in the model
min-Mean, all wages:                          1.6693
min-Mean, controlling for age:                1.6152
min-Mean, controlling for age and cycle:      1.6083
1st ptile-Mean, all wages:                    1.4910
1st ptile-Mean, controlling for age:          1.4282
1st ptile-Mean, controlling for age and       1.4226
 Preferred measure: min-Mean, controls age, cycle
 
 model generates that u is more concentrated for prime-aged
